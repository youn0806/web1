<h2>JavaScript이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>javascript is the standard Markup
language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web application.</p>
<p>JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to
the ECMAScript specification.[9] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled,
and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
object-orientation, and first-class functions.
Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide
Web.[10] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[11] often
incorporating third-party libraries.[12] All major web browsers have a dedicated
JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's
device.</p>
